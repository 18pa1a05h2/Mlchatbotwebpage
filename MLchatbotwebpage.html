 				<p>Doctors alone amongst healthcare professionals must be capable of regularly taking ultimate responsibility for difficult decisions in situations of clinical complexity and uncertainty, drawing on their scientific knowledge and well developed clinical judgement. The doctor's role must be defined by what is in the best interest of patients and of the population served. Based on the definition of the role of a medical doctor proposed by the International Labour Organisation it is agreed that: "Doctors as clinical scientists apply the principles and procedures of medicine to prevent, diagnose, care for and treat patients with illness, disease and injury and to maintain physical and mental health. They supervise the implementation of care and treatment plans by others in the health care team and conduct medical education and research." All healthcare professionals require a set of generic attributes to merit the trust of patients that underpins the therapeutic relationship. These qualities include good communication skills, the ability to work as part of a team, non judgemental behaviour, empathy and integrity. In addition to possessing these shared attributes doctors must be able to:  assess patients' healthcare needs taking into account their personal and social circumstances  apply their knowledge and skills to synthesise information from a variety of sources in order to reach the best available diagnosis and understanding of the patient's problem, or to know what steps need to be taken to secure such an outcome  support patients in understanding their condition and what they might expect, including in those circumstances when patients present with symptoms that could have several causes  identify and advise on appropriate treatment options or preventive measures  explain and discuss the risks, benefits and uncertainties of various tests and treatments and where possible support patients to make decisions about their own care.  The nature of these core requirements emphasises the need to select those with the appropriate attributes for training. Medical undergraduate education must provide a strong grounding in relevant science and in clinical practice as well as providing opportunities to develop an appreciation for research. Doctors must have the ability to assimilate new knowledge critically, have strong intellectual skills and grasp of scientific principles and be capable of dealing effectively with and of managing uncertainty, ambiguity and complexity. They must have the capacity to work out solutions from first principles when the pattern does not fit. All doctors must be demonstrably committed to reflect practice, monitoring their contribution and working continually to improve their own and their team's performance</p>
